                “Everything always looked better in black and white. Everything always 
                as if it were the first time; there’s always more people in a black and 
                white photograph. It just makes it seem that there were more people at a gig, 
                more people at a football match, than with colour photography. Everything looks
                more exciting.”– Jack Lowden
